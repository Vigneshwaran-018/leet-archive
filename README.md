This repo’s a collection of my own LeetCode solutions — handwritten, not copy-pasted. Just me grinding out the problems one bug at a time.

⚠️ Heads up:
Some of these might not pass all the test cases on LeetCode, but the majority of them do work just fine. This is more like my personal progress log than a perfect solution bank.

Feel free to explore, get inspired, or even laugh at some of the cursed logic I’ve written. It's all part of the process

NOTE:
All of the codes are written on IDLE Python shell, just for temporary debugging. None of the codes are written on leetcode style format. But ofcourse, the logics are always the same.
